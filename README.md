Minimal CRYENGINE
=================

Home of the Minimal GameDLL for CRYENGINE, aimed to give developers a good base for new projects.

# Usage

The Minimal project root directory should be merged with a CRYENGINE installation, most commonly [Engine as a Service](http://store.steampowered.com/app/220980/). 

The solution file can be found in Code/Solutions/CRYENGINE_Minimal.sln, but will not compile without the code package obtained from the 'Engine as a Service' package, or licensee builds.

# Compatible Engine Version(s)
The project currently requires CRYENGINE 3.6.14, but will likely compile just fine with other 3.6.* versions.
